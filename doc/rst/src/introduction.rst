``lib_mic_array`` is a library for interfacing with one or more PDM microphones
on an XMOS device.

Version 5.0 of this library has been redesigned from scratch to leverage the
`Vector unit in the XMOS XS3 architecture <https://www.xmos.com/documentation/XM-014007-PS/html/doc/rst/xs3-arch-inst.html#vector-unit>`_.

See :ref:`using_mic_array` to get started.

.. note::

  Version 5.0 does not currently support XS2 or XS1 devices. Please use version 4.5.0 if you need support for these devices: https://github.com/xmos/lib_mic_array/releases/tag/v4.5.0
