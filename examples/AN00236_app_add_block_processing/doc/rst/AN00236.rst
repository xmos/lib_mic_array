Overview
--------

Introduction
............

This demo application takes samples from channel 0 of the summed stereo signal and channels them into a double buffer of configurable size. The output side of the double buffer is processed by a C function implemented in process_buffer.c. 
Arbitrary block processing algorithms can be inserted in that C function. For example algorithms for keyword recognition.

This document a supplement for AN00218. 
It describes adding the functionality depicted in green in the `Block diagram`_:

 - A double buffer which is filled with samples from the i2s_handler task.
 - The output of the double is processed by the a function implemented in C: process_buffer
 - The double buffer memory and control are implemented in the distributable task: double_buffer

See `Source code for app_add_block_processing.xc`_.

Please refer to the AN00218 for additional information.

Configuration
.............

The sample rate can be configured in app_add_block_processing.xc:

.. literalinclude:: app_add_block_processing.xc
   :start-on: // Default is 16 kHz sampling rate.
   :end-on: #define THIRD_STAGE_DIV_FIR 

The sample resolution can be configured in mic_array_conf.h:

.. literalinclude:: mic_array_conf.h
   :start-after: #define MIC_ARRAY_NUM_MICS 8
   :end-before: #endif

The buffer size can be configured in double_buffer.h:

.. literalinclude:: double_buffer.h
   :start-after: #include "mic_array_conf.h"
   :end-before: #if MIC_ARRAY_WORD_LENGTH_SHORT
